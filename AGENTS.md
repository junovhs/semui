This repository is managed by Ishoo and mapped by SEMMAP. Before handling the first user request, call the `ishoo_brief` and `semmap_brief` MCP tools. Drive all issue, plan, and decision work through the `ishoo_*` MCP tools and code navigation through the `semmap_*` tools — do not substitute the Ishoo or SEMMAP command-line interfaces. A failed call is not a missing server: retry before concluding anything, because a dropped transport usually recovers on the next call. Stop only when a server is not configured at all, or retries keep failing. Before stopping, make in-flight work durable — call `ishoo_stop` on any issue you own, or, when Ishoo itself is the unreachable server, commit your changes onto the current execution branch inside the worktree, never pushing and never touching `main`. Then tell the user which server must be enabled.

# Agent bootstrap

Before handling any user request, call the `ishoo_brief` and `semmap_brief`
MCP tools. Use the MCP tools supplied by those servers for their workflows; do
not substitute the Ishoo or SEMMAP command-line interfaces.

If either MCP server or brief tool is unavailable, stop and tell the user which
server must be enabled before continuing.
