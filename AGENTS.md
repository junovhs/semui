Before handling any user request, call the `ishoo_brief` and `semmap_brief`
MCP tools. Use the MCP tools supplied by those servers for their workflows; do
not substitute the Ishoo or SEMMAP command-line interfaces.

If either MCP server or brief tool is unavailable, stop and tell the user which
server must be enabled before continuing.
